Introduction

ARNet is a Netcat-like tool developed by Abdul Rafay, designed to establish bind or reverse TCP connections. This user guide explains how to use ARNet, its features, and its working.

Features

    Establishes bind or reverse TCP connections
    Allows remote command execution
    Enables file transfer between the client and server

How to Use ARNet:
Server Side

    Run the ARNet server script on the server machine.
    The server will listen on port 8080 (default) for incoming connections.

Client Side

    Run the ARNet client script on the client machine.
    The client will connect to the server at 127.0.0.1:8080 (default).
    Once connected, the client will receive commands from the server.
    The client will execute the commands and send the output back to the server.

Commands

    exit: Exits the client and closes the connection.
    Any other command: Will be executed on the client's shell and the output will be sent back to the server.

File Transfer

    To transfer a file from the client to the server, use the send command followed by the file path.
    To transfer a file from the server to the client, use the recv command followed by the file path.

Working

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how ARNet works:

    The client script creates a socket object and defines the server's IP address and port number.
    The client attempts to connect to the server using a while loop and try-except block.
    Once connected, the client receives commands from the server using the recv function.
    The client executes the commands using the subprocess module and sends the output back to the server using the send function.
    If the command is exit, the client breaks out of the loop and closes the socket.
    The server can send multiple commands to the client, and the client will execute each command and send the output back to the server.
